# Digital Hardware

Implementation of a UART transmitter in VHDL.

### Description

This is an implementation of digital systems based on a material architecture. You have to understand:

- The process (combinatorial,synchronous,and testbenches): sensitivity list, signal update.
- Description of state machine (in 2 processes: a synchronous for the state register, another describes the combinatorial logic).
- Description of one or several registers ( with their combinatorial logic upstream) and/or counter(s) in a synchronous process.
- Description of decoding logic in a combinatorial process.
- Design-reuse: uses of generic parameters and types (natural, positive, integer).
